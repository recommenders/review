RecSys Review (RR) is a newsletter for the recommender systems community inspired by [SIGIR Forum](http://sigir.org/forum/). The newsletter attempts to publish two issues per year; one just after the [ACM RecSys](http://recsys.acm.org) submissions, and one just after the annual conference. 

RecSys Review attempts to serve as a medium for dissemination of conference, workshop, and meetup reports, as well as papers, book reviews and other information pertinent to the RecSys community. RecSys Review does not represent the official position of ACM RecSys or ACM. Contributions to the Review are generally unrefereed.


Editors of the RecSys Review are: AS, ME, CM, AB, DP.
