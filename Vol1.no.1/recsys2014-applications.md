# Applications at RecSys 2014

Last year's Recommender Systems conference saw quite a number of different
recommender applications presented; in addition to the demo and poster
sessions, which often have a variety of applications, there were a diverse
array of applications in the technical program beyond the social network,
e-commerce, and movie recommendations that make up many recommender systems
papers.

There were many excellent papers on a variety of topics; my goal in this
particular report is to highlight those papers that worked on particularly
novel applications (or specializations of common applications).

## Full Papers

The technical program led off with a section dedicated to novel applications, containing:

1.  Skill recommendation in LinkedIn (Bastian et al.)
2.  Books for K-12 students (Pera and Ng)
3.  Social network connections (Yuan et al.)
4.  Reviewers for scientific papers (Liu, Suel, and Memon)

Further sections contained a number of additional applications.  Hariri,
Mobasher, and Burke used *artist* recommendation, instead of more typical song
or album recommendation, as the context to test their context-aware
recommender.  Yang, Adamson, and Ros√© presented on a question recommender
designed specifically for MOOCs.

Liu, Xie, and Lakshmanan presented a system for specifically recommending
user-curated lists of items, such as GoodReads item lists, dealing with
particular problems in that recommendation task.

## Short Papers

There were also a number of novel applications displayed in the short paper
presentations:

-   Sui and Burdick described a recommender for stimuli intended to help treat
    paralysis.
-   Daly et al. incorporated transportation availability into a housing
    recommender.
-   Adams et al. used collaborative filtering to adapt health communications to
    the patient.
-   Jannach and Fischer's paper discussed recommending data mining operations
    to people working on data analysis and mining problems.

## Conclusion

I was pleased with the variety of applications on display at this year's
recommender systems conference.  A common thread of RecSys hallway discussions
is that movies and news and shopping are overstudied, at least relative to the
breadth of possible recommender applications, and it was refreshing to see some
very interesting and novel applications this year.
