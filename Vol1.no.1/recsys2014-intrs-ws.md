# Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems (IntRS) at RecSys 2014

The topic on user interfaces and user-centric issues on recommender recsys had an interesting event last year, attracting the attention of several attendants who, in a full-day workshop, discussed about *Ratings*, *Explanations* and *Visualizations*. In this first issue of the RecSys Review two of the organizers, Nava Tintarev and John O'Donovan, present a complete summary of the activities in the workshop which can be found in [this pdf document](./intrws2014-review.pdf).
